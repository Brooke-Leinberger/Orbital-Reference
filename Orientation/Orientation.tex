\chapter{Orientation}
With everything outlined in the first 3 chapters, it's possible to create a complete model of a 2 body orbital system***. However there is a glaring limitation to the model as it is now: It can only describe orbits in a single plane. Without additional work, this model can't describe the difference between a polar orbit and an equatorial orbit if they have the same shape, size, and orbit the same body. The solution to this is encoding into this model a way to describe any configuration of rotation. Note: Everything in this chapter will be describing right-handed orientations. Section x.x will cover left-handed conversions.
